    "description": "We used FAST (Zhang et al., 2001) segmentation to identify tissue classes at subject level and regress WM and CSF from the preprocessed data together with the six motion regressors. The functional data was further coregistered to a volume from each subjects rest run to allow analysis across session in subject space."
