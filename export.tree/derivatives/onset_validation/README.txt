Onset validation was performed through a visual analysis of preprocessed BOLD time courses across all subjects centred on film onset (time = 0). We plotted the average of regional signals from 7Networks_LH_Vis_5 and 7Networks_RH_Vis_4 from the Schaefer 100 parcellation (Schaefer et al., 2018). Onset and offset were displayed as measured with the addition of a 5s lag to account for the delayed hemodynamic response.
